# Modern PHP with no framework

I'm currently learning PHP out in the open and used this [post](https://kevinsmith.io/modern-php-without-a-framework) as a starting to point and jumped in. I'm keeping notes as I go and may publish them at some point.

## Dependencies

- **PHP** - of course :) [install guide](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php).
- **Composer** - dependency manager. See install guide [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies

```
composer install
```

Run local server

```
php -S localhost:8080 -t public/
```

Visit `localhost:8080` in the browser of your choice.

Have a nosey about the code. Have fun 👍🏾
